# Sample AEM project template

This is a project template for AEM-based applications. It is intended as a best-practice set of examples as well as a potential starting point to develop your own functionality.

## Modules

The main parts of the template are:

* [core:](core/README.md) Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* [ui.apps:](ui.apps/README.md) contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS&CSS clientlibs, components, and templates
* [ui.content:](ui.content/README.md) contains sample content using the components from the ui.apps
* ui.config: contains runmode specific OSGi configs for the project
* all: a single content package that embeds all of the compiled modules (bundles and content packages) including any vendor dependencies

## How to build

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish


## Documentation

The build process also generates documentation in the form of README.md files in each module directory for easy reference. Depending on the options you select at build time, the content may be customized to your project.

## Testing

There are three levels of testing contained in the project:

### Unit tests

This show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To
test, execute:

    mvn clean test

## Maven settings
